Scenegraph and Graph Code for FriCAS Program
-------------------------------------------
I created this repository to facilitate discussion of the improvements needed to scenegraph and graph code.

Included here are:

<ul>
  <li>scene.spad</li>
  <li>graph.spad</li>
</ul>

For further information see the documentation here:<ul>

</ul>

TODO
----
1) The code that Franz Lehner sent to me also included isomorphism testing and drawing (using algorithms from Freese's book on "Free Lattices"). I would like to merge this with my code. (it may not all be generalisable to graphs/complexes but parts of it may be and the remainder can still be used for posets).
